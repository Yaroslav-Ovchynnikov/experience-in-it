I want to tell about myself and at the same time show my skills. I'm using GitHub for this. My teachers always taught me: 
> \- _"portfolio is a short biography of your life"_. 

I'm not going to listen "advisers" from "IT courses" about the minimum text for the convenience of HR. If you are HR and don't want to waste the time, you can click on the line below. My GitHub has main information about:
1. **[MYSELF](#MYSELF)**;
2. **[Education](#Education)**;
3. **[Employment history](#Employmenthistory)**;
4. **[Additational education](#Additationaleducation)**;
5. **[Experience in IT](#ExperienceinIT)**;
6. **[My future goals](#Myfuturegoals)**
7. **[Contacts](#Contacts)**.

I'm sure you will be interested. Let's get it on.

My name is Yaroslav Ovchynnikov. I was born in 1994 in **[Lugansk region of Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2,+%D0%9B%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F+%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C,+%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0,+94000/@48.5681885,38.6237227,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x411fc564844c6285:0xf8e02e7e879e7164!2z0JvRg9Cz0LDQvdGB0LosINCb0YPQs9Cw0L3RgdC60LDRjyDQvtCx0LvQsNGB0YLRjCwg0KPQutGA0LDQuNC90LAsIDkxMDAw!3b1!8m2!3d48.574041!4d39.307815!3m4!1s0x40e01cb7e0327015:0x84c7b03353a52256!8m2!3d48.5604202!4d38.6487007?hl=ru)**. I finished school in 2012. I was a professional athlete and the winner of many competitions. I have always had an interest in learning something new. I really liked to play computer games. At that time, my friends and I played CS, created our own clans and participated in tournaments. To promote our clans on the Internet, you need to know _"how to create websites"_. Then I learned how to create sites on the **ucoz** portal. I touched HTML and CSS. It was very exciting. I tried to take courses in HTML, but it was time to enter the university. I couldn't finish courses.

I entered in Donetsk National University in 2012 and studied there until May 2014. When the war started I had to relocated from Donetsk to Kharkov. I entered in Yaroslav Mudryi National Law University and finished it in February 2018. I have degree - **[Master of Laws](/images/Diploma.JPG)**.

## <p align="center"> <a id=Employmenthistory> [``` Employment history ```](#TOP)</a></p>
1. **Relocate from Kharkov to Dnipro.**
    - I relocated from Kharkov to Dnipro in 2018 and became a legal adviser in a national service company "BaDM" LLC. I worked from April 2018 to May 2019. The main task is work with contracts.
2. **Relocate from Dnipro to Kiev.**
    - I relocated from Dnipro to Kyiv in January 2020. The next I got a job as a lawyer in the law firm "Go-to Legal" in April 2020 and worked there until Januar 2021. The main task is work with contract, protect the rights of a clients in a courts and business support of the international IT company "Playtika" LLC and another international companies (for ex.: _Weiwo Ukraine Mobile Communication, Candy Hoover OY, Oasis Communication Technologies and others_);  
    - In January 2021 I received an offer of the law company "PROVE GROUP" to participate in a large project related to protecting the interests of a client in a criminal case. I studied at **["Higher School of Advocacy"](/images/Certificate%20HSA.jpg)** and successfully completed it. After that, I have a position - "Assistant Attorney" and the **[certificate](/images/Certificate%20Assis.jpeg)**.This project has already been completed today. We protected the rights of the client and saved him from the real term and the loss of a large amount of property.

We have completed the last project until February 2022. The war that began on February 24, 2022 changed everything. Law firms have as much suffered as their clients and there aren`t perspectives. This additionally prompted the decision to change my activities as a specialist. By the way, completed IT courses were useful.

I am planning to change my profession. I want to work in a fast growing IT industry with confederate people. I clearly understand my experience in the modern world is not enough, but I am very motivated. I am ready to work overtime, if only to gain as much experience as possible and benefit the company and the team. Life situations have happened in my life contribute to selfless actions. I know *"how to bring every case that I take to the final"*.
